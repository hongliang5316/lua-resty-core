get_uri_ext
-----------
**syntax:** *ext = ngx_req.get_uri_ext(max?)*

**context:** *set_by_lua&#42;, rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;, header_filter_by_lua&#42;, body_filter_by_lua&#42;, log_by_lua&#42;, balancer_by_lua&#42;*

Returns the file extension of request URL.

The optional `max` argument (default 255) is a number that when specified, will return
the `max` length of file extension when the actual length is greater then `max`.

```nginx

 location = /test.m3u8 {
     content_by_lua_block {
         local ngx_req = require "ngx.req"
         local ext = ngx_req.get_uri_ext()
         ngx.say(ext)
     }
 }
```

If the request URL has no extension the empty string "" will be returned.
